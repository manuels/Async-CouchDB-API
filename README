This is a modified version of the javascript file you usually get when you call http://localhost:5984/_utils/script/couch.js but this version works asynchronously!

The modification looks like this:
- You can specify a default error callback function at {this,CouchDB}.errorCallback
- The first argument of any function is usually the callback function that is executed when the command succeeded
  Then the ordinary arguments follow
  The last (optional) argument is the error callback function

You can specify a base url at {this,CouchDB}.server. Usually this is not supported when you use a browser, but it works (and is needed) for QML.



Example:

If your synchronous call looked like this:
console.log( CouchDB.getVersion() );

it looks like this in the asynchronous version:
CouchDB.getVersion(console.log);
